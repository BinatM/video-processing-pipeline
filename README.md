# video-processing-pipeline
This is a project about refining a shaky walking-person video using a Python/OpenCV pipeline into six outputs: a stabilized clip; full-color extracted and binary-mask videos; an alpha-matte composite; a matted result; and a bounding-box–tracked final video—all via a single command.
